This Keto vanilla butter coffee makes a great fat-fueled breakfast option to kickstart your day. Alternatively, this is perfect served with a slice of low-carb cake as an afternoon treat!\n\n### What ingredients are in this Keto vanilla butter latte?\n\nThis Keto vanilla BULLETPROOF® coffee is prepared with hot almond milk infused with sweet vanilla extract. The milk is then blended with instant coffee and a hearty helping of unsalted butter, before being blitzed until super frothy! We have used a handheld stick blender to froth and blend our Keto coffee, however, you may use a freestanding blender for this if preferred.\n\n### Here are some tips to make Keto vanilla butter coffee?\n\nThis Keto BULLETPROOF® coffee provides a generous serving of fats from unsalted butter. If preferred you may swap the butter for coconut oil or BULLETPROOF® brain octane oil (MCT Oil) or even a blend of fats. You may also swap the erythritol for your preference in low-carb sweetener or omit it entirely if desired. Please be sure to adjust your macros for any changes made.\n\n### Can you use freshly brewed coffee in this Keto recipe?\n\nWhile this recipe calls for instant coffee, you can definitely substitute it for espresso or freshly brewed coffee, just make sure its strong.\n\nBULLETPROOF® is a registered trademark owned by Bulletproof Digital, Inc.",
